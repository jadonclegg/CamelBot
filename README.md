# CamelBot
A bot that proxies your Java server and manages your Discord.

This is under development
# TODO
- [ ] Build a proxy to forward players to the servers themselves
- [ ] Implement transferring between servers using commands
- [ ] Implement running commands from the game
- [ ] Implement AIML to make CamelBot more lifelike and get rid of commands (maybe)
- [x] Regulate content in Discord channels
- [ ] Configure all CamelBot features from a configuration file
- [ ] Update specific servers from a command using wget
- [ ] Maybe init setup for new servers?
