# CamelBot
A bot that proxies your Java server and manages your Discord.
To set this up, download the index.json and create your own configs like the ones here.
For each server you must download CamelWrapper to connect to CamelBot and install CamelMod in the mod folder of your fabric (only fabric for now) mod folder. 

This is under development
